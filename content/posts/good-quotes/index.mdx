> All highly successful people treat life, business, and success just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.
>
> - There’s the First Door, where 99% of people wait in line, hoping to get in.
> - There’s the Second Door, where billionaires and royalty slip through.
>
> But then there is always, always…the Third Door. It’s the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, climb over the dumpster, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, and sneak through the kitchen. But there’s always a way in.
> Whether it’s how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software, how Steven Spielberg became the youngest studio director in Hollywood history, they all took the Third Door.  
> **from The Third Door: The Mindset of Success by Alex Banayan**

> “There isn’t a move that’s a new move.” The basketball star Kobe Bryant has admitted that all of his moves on the court were stolen from watching tapes of his heroes. But initially, when Bryant stole a lot of those moves, he realized he couldn’t completely pull them off because he didn’t have the same body type as the guys he was thieving from. He had to adapt the moves to make them his own.

> **by Guy Kiwasaki**

> "What you care about when writing software: simplicity, communication, feedback, courage, respect."
> **by Kent Beck**

> "What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere. All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original."  
> "What is originality? Undetected plagiarism."  
> "Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing."  
> "If you have one person you’re influenced by, everyone will say you’re the next whoever. But if you rip off a hundred people, everyone will say you’re so original!"  
> "It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique."

> "A venture that doesn’t create value for others is a hobby. A venture that doesn’t attract attention is a flop. A venture that doesn’t sell the value it creates is a nonprofit. A venture that doesn’t deliver what it promises is a scam. A venture that doesn’t bring in enough money to keep operating will inevitably close."
> "Business fundamental. 1. Value Creation. Discovering what people need or want, then creating it. 2. Marketing. Attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created. 3. Sales. Turning prospective customers into paying customers. 4. Value Delivery. Giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring that they’re satisfied. 5. Finance. Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile."  
> **from The Personal MBA**

> "I think it’s good to have a lot of projects going at once so you can bounce between them. When you get sick of one project, move over to another, and when you’re sick of that one, move back to the project you left. Practice productive procrastination."  
> "This is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you’re doing really good work. There’s no pressure when you’re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you’re unknown, there’s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge paycheck on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on. You’ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money."  
> "Complain about the way other people make software by making software."  
> **from Steal Like An Artist by Austin Kleon**

> "If you set up your business like you don’t need the money, people are happier to pay you"  
> "We’ve all heard about the importance of persistence. But I had misunderstood. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working. We all have lots of ideas, creations, and projects. When you present one to the world and it’s not a hit, don’t keep pushing it as is. Instead, get back to improving and inventing"  
> “What if every musician just set up their own store on their own website? Since that’d be the death of CD Baby, how do you plan to stop that? Honestly, I don’t care about CD Baby. I only care about the musicians. If someday, musicians don’t need CD Baby anymore, that’s great! I’ll just shut it down and get back to making music."  
> **from Anything You Want**
