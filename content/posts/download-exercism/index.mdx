Hi guys. I really like exercism to learn a new language when it has lots of test covered on every exercise.
And you can also download it into your computer.

However, you have to manually download each exercise one by one and it's pissed me off!
Then I found a way on Github that let us download them all at once. [Download all items for given track · Issue #718 · exercism/cli (github.com)](https://github.com/exercism/cli/issues/718)
Big shout out for people who contribute to this thread!

**Step 1:** copy this into a new bash file (Ex: download_exercism.sh)

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set -u

export track="$1"

curl \
  --silent --fail \
  "https://exercism.org/api/v2/tracks/$track/exercises" \
  | sed 's/"slug":"/\n/g' \
  | sed 's/",.*$//' \
  | grep -v '"exercises":' \
  | while read -r slug; do
      exercism download --track="$track" --exercise="$slug"
    done
```

**Step 2:** make it executable

```sh
chmod +x download_exercism.sh
```

**Step 3:** execute it with the track you want to download and all exercises will be downloaded into your $HOME directory.

```
./download_exercism.sh gleam
```

**Note:** if you got any error message related to the restriction of downloading lock exercises.  
You have to click **Disable Learning Mode** to unlock all exercises before download them as the image below.
