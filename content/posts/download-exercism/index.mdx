Hi guys. I really like exercism when it has lots of test covered on each exercise.  
However, downloading each exercise one by one pissed me off!

Then I found a way on Github that let us download them all at once.  
[Download all items for given track · Issue #718 · exercism/cli (github.com)](https://github.com/exercism/cli/issues/718)  
Big shout out for people in this thread!

**Step 1:** create new bash file with below content (Ex: vi download_exercism.sh)

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set -u

export track="$1"

curl \
  --silent --fail \
  "https://exercism.org/api/v2/tracks/$track/exercises" \
  | sed 's/"slug":"/\n/g' \
  | sed 's/",.*$//' \
  | grep -v '"exercises":' \
  | while read -r slug; do
      exercism download --track="$track" --exercise="$slug"
    done
```

**Step 2:** make it executable

```sh
chmod +x download_exercism.sh
```

**Step 3:** execute it with the track you want to download.

```
./download_exercism.sh gleam
```

All exercises will be downloaded into your $HOME directory.

**Note:** if you got any error message related to the restriction of downloading lock exercises.  
You have to click **Disable Learning Mode** to unlock all exercises before download them as the image below.
