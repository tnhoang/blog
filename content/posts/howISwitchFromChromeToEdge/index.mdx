#### 1. Sync with Gmail

Follows these steps to setup Edge:

1. Create a microsoft account with your Gmail
2. Login into Edge with your new account
3. In Chrome, **export** your current bookmarks to a file
4. In Edge, **import** bookmark with the previous file
5. Wait Edge to sync and done

It looks tedious but you only need to do it once.

#### 2. Vertical tabs

See tabs in vertical looks more easy to navigate than horizontal.  
You can **right click** in tabs area and turn it on as below image.

#### Conclusion

They're userful built-in features that doesn't exist in Chrome. I love them so much.  
There are many more wonderful features that I can't list them all here.  
So once you switch to Edge, you won't regret, I swear!
