## # What I like

### Read aloud 📣

As you may know, for reading text aloud, you can use some chrome extension like: a,b... Unfortunately, the reading voice is kinda like
robot.  
But in Edge, the voice sounds more human-like.
You can check the voice below.

### Vertical tabs 🁻

I don't know whether you can align tabs vertically in Chrome but it's a default feature in Edge.  
You can do multiple things with this: hover to expand, pin tab, close below tabs...

### Switch to last active tab 🔄

This feature is fantastic.  
When I want to switch between 2 tabs back and forward in my "jungle tabs", I have to place them next to each other so that I can switch between them(using Ctrl+tab/Ctrl+Shift+tab). It's kinda odd 😐.

But in Edge, you dont need to worry about those things any more.  
Just: Ctrl+`. Awesome!!!

## # What I don't like

Only one sign-in way: Microsoft account, not Google (of course! 🤷‍♂️)
