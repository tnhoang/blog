> All highly successful people treat life, business, and success just like a nightclub. There are always three ways in.
>
> - There’s the First Door, where 99% of people wait in line, hoping to get in.
> - There’s the Second Door, where billionaires and royalty slip through.
>
> But then there is always, always…the Third Door. It’s the entrance where you have to jump out of line, run down the alley, climb over the dumpster, bang on the door a hundred times, crack open the window, and sneak through the kitchen. But there’s always a way in.
> Whether it’s how Bill Gates sold his first piece of software, or how Steven Spielberg became the youngest director at a major studio in Hollywood — they all took the Third Door.

> Don't "work harder." Instead:  
> Cut away distractions.  
> Stop doing fake work.  
> Ask for help.  
> Plan.  
> Solicit criticism.  
> Automate what can be automated.  
> Engage your mentors.  
> Exercise.  
> Get more sleep.  
> Whatever you do, don't "work harder." It's pretty much never the answer.

> instead of learning from your own.
